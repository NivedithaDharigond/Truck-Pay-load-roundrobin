# Truck-Pay-load-roundrobin
Truck payload scheduling using the Round Robin algorithm ensures balanced load distribution among a fleet by cyclically assigning payloads to each truck in sequence. This prevents overburdening, maintains efficiency, and is simple to implement, though adjustments may be needed for varying truck capacities or specific constraints.
